# Optimizing-Cargo-Allocation-Using-Linear-Optimization-with-Gurobi

In this project, we implemented linear optimization using Gurobi in Python to determine the optimal allocation of cargo items across multiple planes and locations while accounting for fluctuating supply and demand. The objective was to maximize efficiency by ensuring optimal space utilization, minimizing costs, and meeting demand constraints dynamically.

We formulated the problem as a linear programming model, incorporating constraints such as cargo weight limits, plane capacities, location-specific supply and demand variations, and transportation restrictions. Using Gurobi’s optimization solver, we developed a scalable and adaptive solution that dynamically adjusted allocations in response to real-time changes in cargo availability and demand.

This project showcased my ability to apply mathematical optimization techniques to real-world logistics challenges, leveraging Gurobi’s solver to drive data-driven decision-making and enhance operational efficiency.
